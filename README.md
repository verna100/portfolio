# updated-portfolio
This is an updated portfolio/bio page- attaching resume, twitter/facebook/linkedIn info

https://verna100.github.io/updated-portfolio/

This portfolio was made using a free template available online. I customized the page to be my own per permissions and documentation offered and I have attached those permissions/code packages to my repo. I chose to go this route as opposed to paying for a template as suggested. I did contribute styling/photos/all information as well as all my own links and have added the creator of the code template to the copyright section on the footer of the page.
